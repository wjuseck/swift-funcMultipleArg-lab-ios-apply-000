/*: question1
 ### 1. Create a function that will take in a continent and the number of countries in that continent. It should print the following sentence "____ is a continent which contains ___ countries".
 */
// write your code here

func countryCount(continent: String, country: Int) -> String {
    let counter = "The continent of \(continent) has \(country) countries."
    return counter
}

let NA = countryCount(continent: "North America", country: 12)

print(NA)

/*: question2
 ### 2. Can you see why the code below doesn't work? Fix the function call to get rid of the error.
 */
func greeting(name: String, greeting: String) {
    print("\(greeting), \(name)!")
}

greeting(name: "Danny", greeting: "Hello")




/*: question3
 ### 3. This function doesn't work, either. Can you fix the function (_not_ the call) so that it works?
 */
func daysInMonth(month: String, days: Int) {
    print("There are \(days) days in \(month)")
}

daysInMonth(month: "November", days: 30)




/*: question4
 ### 4. So far, you have created functions that take two arguments. Can you create (and call) one that takes three? Try to create a function that three parameters: a beverage, the number of bottles of that beverage, and a place you can keep those bottles. Print the sentence "____ bottles of ____ on the ____ wall."
 */
// write your code here

func sodaSong(beverage: String, numberOfBottles: Int, locationOfBottles: String) -> String {
    let song = "\(numberOfBottles) bottles of \(beverage) on the \(locationOfBottles) wall."
    return song
}

let annoyingSong = sodaSong(beverage: "Sprite", numberOfBottles: 20, locationOfBottles: "South")
print(annoyingSong)
